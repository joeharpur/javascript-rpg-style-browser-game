From index.py you can either register a new player or login using username: Guest and password: 123

If an icon appears above your head ingame, you can interact with it using the spacebar.

Key objects for interaction are the soldier in the bottom left, the houses, the balloon stall,
the river, and the signpost.

Highscores are displayed by interacting with the signpost. A user can only have one highscore
per game. This will be overwritten if you achive a better score. A max of five scores are
shown per game

The house in the top left contains a 'fortune teller' who obtains random fortunes from a database.

Enjoy!
